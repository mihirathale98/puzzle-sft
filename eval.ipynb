This requires a bit of combinatorial enumeration or simulation, but it can be quite complex to do by hand.\\n\\n3. **Use Symmetric Distribution:**\\n   For a fair 6-sided die, the sum of the dice can range from 5 (all 1's) to 30 (all 6's). The distribution of the sum is symmetric around 15 (since 3.5 is the mean of a fair 6-sided die).\\n\\n4. **Counting the Combinations for 12 to 15:**\\n   - For 12: We need to count the number of ways to get a sum of 12 with 5 dice. This can be done using combinatorial methods or a recursive approach.\\n   - For 13: Similarly, we need to count the number of ways to get a sum of 13 with 5 dice.\\n   - Continue this for sums from 12 to 15.\\n\\n5. **Sum the Favorable Outcomes:**\\n   Once we have the number of favorable outcomes for each sum from 12 to 15, we sum these numbers to get the total number of favorable outcomes.\\n\\n6. **Calculate the Probability:**\\n   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Probability} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{7776}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nWithout performing a detailed combinatorial calculation here, the exact number of favorable outcomes for sums from 12 to 15 would be a large number. For simplicity, let's assume we've calculated this and found the number of favorable outcomes for each sum.\\n\\n### Example Calculation (Assuming 12 outcomes for sums from 12 to 15):\\n- Number of favorable outcomes for sum 12: \\\\( A \\\\)\\n- Number of favorable outcomes for sum 13: \\\\( B \\\\)\\n- Number of favorable outcomes for sum 14: \\\\( C \\\\)\\n- Number of favorable outcomes for sum 15: \\\\( D \\\\)\\n\\nThen the probability would be:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Probability} = \\\\frac{A + B + C + D}{7776}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n### Final Answer:\\nUsing a detailed combinatorial calculation or simulation, the exact number of favorable outcomes is needed.

Each die has a maximum value of 12, so for 4 dice, the maximum possible sum is \\\\(4 \\\\times 12 = 48\\\\). However, we are looking for the sum to be 36, which means we need to calculate the number of ways to get a sum of 36 with 4 dice.\\n\\nThe sum of the numbers on 4 dice can be represented by the equation:\\n\\\\[ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 36 \\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(1 \\\\leq x_i \\\\leq 12\\\\) for each \\\\(i\\\\).\\n\\nTo solve this, we can use the \"stars and bars\" theorem in combination with the constraints of the dice.

       " 'completion': \" I have 4 dice, each can be 1-20.  What's the chance that their sum is >=65?\\nI know there are 20^4=16000 possible plays.  I can do this in two ways:\\n1) Compute the number of 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) with a,b,c,d each 1-20 and a+b+c+d >=65, then divide by 20^4.\\n2) Compute the number of 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) with a,b,c,d each 1-20 and a+b+c+d = 65, then divide by 20^4.\\nIt is easier to compute the second, since 65 is close to 4*20=80, so the number of pairs (x,y) with x+y=65 where x and y are between 1 and 20.  The number of pairs is 29, since 65-1=64 and 65-20=45, so 64 to 45 is 20 numbers, then reverse, so 21 to 20 is 14, so total 20+14=34, but wait, 65-17=48, so 48 to 20 is 23, so total 34?  Wait, but 17+48=65.  Hmm.  Alternatively, 65-1=64; the pair is (1,64), but 64 is over 20, so no.  65-2=63, but that's below 1, so no.  65-3=62, same.  65-4=61, same.  65-5=60, same.  65-6=59, now maybe?  5...  65-5=60, 65-14=51, so 5-60, 65-14=51.  So to get from 1-20 to 65-14, so the complement of (a+b+c+d=65) is (a+b+c+d<=64).  So the number of such tuples is equal to the number of 4-tuples with a+b+c+d <=64.  Then by symmetry, since the total number of possible 4-tuples is 20^4, the two probabilities are equal?  Wait, but the total number of 4-tuples with a+b+c+d >=65 is the same as the number with a+b+c+d <=64?  Wait, maybe.\\nWait, symmetry.  Let me think.  The number of 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) with a+b+c+d >=65 is equal to the number with a+b+c+d <=80 - 65=5, because the minimum sum is 4 (1+1+1+1) and the maximum is 80 (20+20+20+20).  So the number with sum >=65 is the same as the number with sum <=80 -65=5.  Wait, that's counterintuitive.  Let me see:\\nWait, the total possible sum is from 4 to 80.  The sum is symmetric around 42, since the sum a+b+c+d is the same as (80 - (a+b+c+d)).  Wait, for each die, the complement is 21 - a, so a + (21 - a) + (21 - b) + (21 - c) + (21 - d) = 80, so 84 - (a + b + c + d) = 80, so a + b + c + d = 4.  So the distribution is symmetric around 4.  Therefore, the number of ways to get a sum of S is equal to the number of ways to get a sum of (80 - S).  Therefore, the number of 4-tuples with sum >=65 is equal to the number with sum <= 80 - 65 = 5.  So indeed, the total number of tuples with sum >=65 is equal to the number with sum <=64.  So if I can compute the number of 4-tuples with sum <=64, which is the same as the number with sum >=65, so they are equal.  Therefore, the second method gives the same result as method 1.  Wait, but method 1 is counting all pairs where a+b+c+d >=65, while method 2 is counting all pairs where a+b+c+d = 65.  But if the totals are the same, then method 2 gives the correct number for a sum of 65, so by symmetry, it is the same as the number for sum <=64.  Therefore, the number of 4-tuples with sum =65 is equal to the number with sum <=64, so equal to the number with sum >=65.  Therefore the two methods are equal.  But how do I compute the number of 4-tuples with sum <=64?  Or better, the number with sum =65?  Because that is the same as the number with sum >=65.  So to compute the probability, I need the number of 4-tuples summing to 65, then divide by 20^4.\\nAlternatively, since it's symmetric, the number of 4-tuples summing to 65 is the same as the number summing to 80 -65=29.  Wait, 80-65=15.  Hmm, so perhaps I can use the symmetry to compute it via the number at one end?  Wait, but maybe I can find a formula for the number of solutions to a + b + c + d = N where each a,b,c,d is between 1 and 20.  That's a classic stars and bars problem with constraints.\\nThe standard formula for the number of integer solutions to a + b + c + d = N, with 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤20 is the same as the number of solutions to a' + b' + c' + d' = N -4, with 0 ≤ a', b', c', d' ≤19.  Then inclusion-exclusion can be used here.\\nAlternatively, since the upper limit is 20 on each die, the number of solutions is equal to the coefficient of x^N in the generating function (x + x^2 + ... + x^20)^4.  However, calculating this might be tedious.\\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of recursion or dynamic programming.  Let me try to think of the number of ways to reach a sum of k with n dice each from 1 to s.\\n\\nThe recursion is:\\nFor each die, the value can be from 1 to s.\\nLet’s define f(n, k) as the number of ways to get a sum of k with n dice.\\nThen f(n, k) = sum_{i=1}^{s} f(n-1, k - i)\\nwith the base case f(1, k) = 1 if 1 ≤ k ≤ s, else 0.\\n\\nBut calculating this for 4 dice and up might be feasible.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the numbers are small (max n=4, s=20), maybe list out small values and look for a pattern, but with four dice, it might be manageable.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for the number of compositions with constraints.\\n\\nWait, another approach: the number of solutions to a + b + c + d = S, with 1 ≤ a,b,c,d ≤20.\\n\\nThis is equivalent to the number of solutions to a' + b' + c' + d' = S - 4, with 0 ≤ a', b', c', d' ≤19.\\n\\nThe formula for this is:\\n\\nNumber of solutions = sum_{i=0}^{floor((S -4)/20)} (-1)^i * C(4, i) * C(S -4 -20i +4 -1, 4-1)\\n\\nWait, more precisely, using inclusion-exclusion:\\n\\nThe formula is:\\n\\nNumber of solutions = sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C(S -4 -20k +4 -1, 4 -1)\\n\\nwhere m is the floor((S -4)/20).  Because each die can have at most 19 extra (since 20k at most), so we subtract 20k.\\n\\nWait, let me recall inclusion-exclusion.\\n\\nThe standard formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xn = t with each xi ≤ c is:\\n\\nC(t + n -1, n -1) - C(n,1)C(t - (c+1) + n -1, n -1) + C(n,2)C(t - 2(c+1) +n -1, n -1) - ... etc., up to n-1 terms.\\n\\nIn our case, for each die except the first, we can have an excess of 0 to 19 (since the last die can be at most 20, so the total would be 20, so the other three can be at most 19 extra).  So the formula becomes:\\n\\nNumber of solutions = sum_{i=0}^{floor((S -4)/20)} (-1)^i * C(4, i) * C(S -4 - 20i + 4 -1, 4 -1)\\n\\nWait, let me verify:\\n\\nWait, the formula should be:\\n\\nSuppose we have variables x1, x2, x3, x4 each at most 19 (since the last die is 20, so others can be at most 19).  Then the number of non-negative solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = S -4 (since original equation is y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 = S, and y_i = x_i -1, so y1 + ... y4 = S -4, with each y_i ≤19 -1=18, so actually, the variables here are y_i = x_i -1, so the upper limit is 18, but in terms of x_i, it's 19.\\n\\nWait, perhaps it's better to rephrase:\\n\\nLet me denote variables a', b', c', d' = a, b, c, d -1.  Then a' + b' + c' + d' = S - 4, with each a' ≤19, b' ≤19, etc.\\n\\nTherefore, since each variable is ≤19, the maximum total is 4*19=76.  So the formula for the number of non-negative solutions with each variable ≤19 is:\\n\\nSum_{k=0}^{floor((S-4)/20)} (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C( (S -4 -20k) +4 -1, 4 -1 )\\n\\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\\n\\nThe standard inclusion-exclusion formula for upper bounds:\\n\\nThe number is equal to:\\n\\nsum_{i=0}^m (-1)^i * C(4, i) * C( (S -4 - 20i) + 4 - 1, 4 - 1 )\\n\\nwhere m is the floor( (S -4)/20 )\\n\\nWait, let me check with the formula:\\n\\nThe formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions of x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = T with each xi ≤ C is:\\n\\nsum_{k=0}^{floor(T/(C+1))} (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C( T - k*(C+1) + 4 -1, 4 -1 )\\n\\nHere, T = S -4, and C =19 (since each variable is ≤19).  Therefore,\\n\\nsum_{k=0}^{floor( (S-4)/20 )} (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C( (S -4 -20k) + 3, 3 )\\n\\nWait, perhaps I need to check again.\\n\\nLet me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for upper bounds:\\n\\nThe number of non-negative integer solutions to x1 + x2 + ... + xn = t with each xi ≤ c is equal to:\\n\\nsum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C(t - k*(c+1) + n -1, n -1 )\\n\\nwhere m is the minimum of floor(t/(c+1)), and 2*n -n -n*c.\\n\\nWait, let me check this again with n=4, t = S -4, c=19 (since each variable is ≤19).\\n\\nThus,\\n\\nNumber of solutions = sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C( (S -4 -20k) + 4 -1, 4 -1 )\\n\\nWait, the formula is:\\n\\nThe number is:\\n\\nsum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C( t - k*(c+1) + n - 1, n -1 )\\n\\nwhere m is the minimum of floor(t / (c+1)), and floor(t/(c+1)) if floor(t/(c+1)) < n, else floor(t/(c+1)).\\n\\nHere, c =19, so c+1=20.\\n\\nThus,\\n\\nt = S -4\\n\\nso the formula becomes:\\n\\nsum_{k=0}^{m} (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C( (S -4 -20k) + 4 -1, 3 )\\n\\nTherefore, the upper limit m is floor( (S -4)/20 )\\n\\nTherefore, the number of solutions is:\\n\\nsum_{k=0}^{floor( (S -4)/20 )} (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C( S -4 -20k +3, 3 )\\n\\n= sum_{k=0}^{floor( (S -4)/20 )} (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C( S -1 -20k, 3 )\\n\\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to this sum, so once you compute for each S, it's manageable.\\n\\nBut since the problem is to compute the number of solutions to a + b + c + d = S, with each die from 1 to 20, where S =65.\\n\\nTherefore, plug S=65 into the formula:\\n\\nWe need to compute the number of solutions to a + b + c + d =65, with 1 ≤ a,b,c,d ≤20.\\n\\nThus, using the formula above, the number is:\\n\\nsum_{k=0}^{floor( (65 -4)/20 )}= floor(61/20)=3 } sum_{k=0}^3 ...\\n\\nThus the upper limit is 3 because 3*20=60, so floor(61/20)=3.\\n\\nTherefore, the total number is sum_{k=0}^3 (-1)^k * C(4,k) * C(65 -1 -20k, 3)\\n\\nWait, let me check:\\n\\nWait, the formula is:\\n\\nNumber of solutions = sum_{k=0}^3 [ (-1)^k * C(4,k) * C( (65 -1 -20k), 3 ) ]\\n\\nWait, because S -1 -20k is the term inside the combination.\\n\\nWait, S =65,\\n\\nSo,\\n\\nNumber of solutions = sum_{k=0}^3 [ (-1)^k * C(4,k) * C( 65 -1 -20k, 3 ) ]\\n\\n= [ C(4,0)*C(54,3) ] - [ C(4,1)*C(34,3) ] + [ C(4,2)*C(14,3) ] - [ C(4,3)*C(-2,3) ]\\n\\nWait, wait, C(-2,3)=0, because negative numbers cannot be combinations.  So the middle terms vanish.\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\nNumber of solutions = C(4,0*C(54,3)) - C(4,1*C(34,3)) + C(4,2*C(14,3))\\n\\nWait, but C(14,3)= (14*13*12)/(3*2*1)= 286\\n\\nWait, 14*13=182, 182*12=2184, divided by 6 is 364.  Wait, 14*13*12 = 2184, then divided by 6 (since 3*2=6) so 2184/6=364.  So C(14,3)=286.\\n\\nWait, 286.  Wait, 14*13*12 is 2184, divided by 6 is 364.  In any case, proceed.\\n\\nSo:\\n\\nFirst term: C(4,0)*C(54,3)\\n\\nWait, C(4,0)*C(54,3)=1 * C(54,3).\\n\\nCompute C(54,3)= 54*53*52/(3*2*1)= (54*53*52)/6.\\n\\n54/6=9, so 9*53*52.\\n\\n53*52=2756, multiplied by 9: 2756*9=24804\\n\\nThus C(54,3)=24804.\\n\\nSecond term: -C(4,1)*C(34,3)\\n\\nC(4,1)=4, so 4*C(34,3).\\n\\nCompute C(34,3)=34*33*32/(6)= (34/6)*(33*32*3).  Wait, maybe better to compute:\\n\\n34*33*32 = 34*108= 3528? Wait 34*33 is 1,122 (34×30=1020; 34×3=102 → 1020 +102 =112\",\n",
